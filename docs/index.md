## Introduction
One of the most beloved aspects of Minecraft is the ability to create breathtaking mansions, secret hideouts, and more. All of the costs and physics of the world no longer hold the player back. Although it is incredibly fun to conceptualize different structures to build, the design is only the beginning. The player must take on the tedious and time-consuming task of building the entire thing block by block. Here is where our project Collabuilder comes to the rescue. Imagine having a full construction squad consisting of smart AI that work together to completely build out any blueprint you provide. After doing the hard work of creating your design, you can sit back, grab a drink, and watch them get busy! On our project website, you can learn how this is possible, what kind of hurdles we had to overcome, and see how the project progressed over time.
