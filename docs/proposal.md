## Summary:
Our project is a multi agent AI with multiple builders working together to construct a house. We plant to have each individual builder use a neural network trained through reinforcement learning and curriculum learning.

## AI/ML Algorithm
* Some form of Q-learning
* A* search (for navigation)

## Evaluation Plan
* Individual:
	* Being able to place the correct block
	* Being able to accomplish their specific task (e.g. being able to place the foundations of the house)
* Team: 
	* Qualitative evaluation of whether they are actually collaborating or just doing their own thing and no interfering with each other (i.e. are they communicating with each other effectively)
	* Being able to construct any house given a floor plan of varying complexity
